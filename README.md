## Contents
* Core and utility R functions for analysis of 14C Summed Probability Distribution, including hypothesis testing against fitted null models (Exponential and Uniform distribution) and a permutation test for comparing two or more observed datasets. 
* Script for generating figure 1~3 on the paper "Summed Probability Distribution of 14C Dates suggest divergence in the population dynamics of Central and Northern Japan during the Jomon Period"
* 14C Dates from Hokkaido, Aomori, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Tokyo, Saitama, Kanagawa, and Chiba prefectures in Japan
* Site location (approximate to ~1km) of the 14C samples
